gene-abcc11-text = ABCC11 encodes a protein that transports molecules across the cell membranes of sweat glands. The T variant lowers protein levels causing dryer earwax and reduced sweating. C variant carriers sweat more. The T variant is common in Eastern Asia. C is found mostly in Africa and Europe. Dry earwax and less sweat could be an adaptation to a colder climate.  
gene-abcc11-short-text = What a nice perfume!
gene-abo-text = The ABO gene encodes a protein that influences human blood types. The protein modifies molecules on the surface of red blood cells. Depending on the variant, the ABO gene produces different proteins leading to different modifications of the cell surface molecules and the three different blood types  A, B and 0. C-variant carriers, for example, have blood type B.
gene-abo-short-text = You have blood-type B!
gene-actn3-text = The ACTN3 gene encodes a protein active in skeletal muscles, which influences the muscles' "explosive" power. T-variant carriers (ca. 17-25% of the human population) have less muscle power, reduced sprinting performance and higher endurance. In contrast, C-variant carriers have greater muscle strength. Only 2-3% of sprinting variability is explained by the C variant, and diet and training contribute strongly to performance.
gene-actn3-short-text = Wow! Look at these muscles!
gene-aldh2-text = The ALDH2 gene encodes a protein that metabolizes alcohol. A-variant carriers are sensitive to alcohol. They are, for example, more likely to suffer from severe hangovers or have a red face and neck. The A variant is over-represented in Asians, but it is not understood why...
gene-aldh2-short-text = Perhaps more sensitive than others to alcohol!
gene-apoe-text = The APOE gene encodes a protein involved in cholesterol metabolism in the liver and brain. The C variant is associated with a risk of developing late-onset sporadic Alzheimer. The observed effect is less severe in Africans than in Caucasians and Asians, because cholesterol levels in Africans are lower.
gene-apoe-short-text = This mutation is associated with a risk of Alzheimer.
gene-ar-text = The AR gene encodes a protein that binds the male hormone androgene. Androgene influences the development of male traits as well as hair growth. The G variant increases the risk of baldness. However, additional variants are needed for baldness to occur.
gene-ar-short-text = Oops, you're losing your hair!
gene-braf-text = The BRAF gene encodes a protein which influences cell proliferation. The mutation from T to A increases BRAF protein activity. The BRAF gene is mutated in 40-60% of skin melanomas. Drugs that target overactive BRAF protein could be a potential treatment.
gene-braf-short-text = Protect yourself from the sun!
gene-brca1-text = The BRCA1 gene encodes a protein that repairs DNA. If DNA repair mechanisms are defective, other genes might also mutate. When BRCA1 gene is mutated, women have a higher risk of breast cancer. 
gene-brca1-short-text = This mutation is associated with a risk of breast cancer.
gene-cyp1a2-text = The CYP1A2 gene encodes a protein involved in various metabolic processes such as caffeine degradation for example. A-variant carriers metabolize caffeine much faster than C-variant carriers. Fast caffeine metabolizers can therefore drink more coffee because the caffeine remains less time in their system.
gene-cyp1a2-short-text = Coffee, or no coffee?
gene-edar-text = The EDAR gene encodes a protein involved in skin, hair and tooth development during embryogenesis. C-variant carriers have thicker and straighter hair for example; many Asians carry the C variant. 
gene-edar-short-text = Your hair is thick and straight!
gene-epor-text = The EPOR gene encodes a protein that controls red blood cell proliferation and prevents them from dying. The A mutation is very rare and causes a strong increase in red blood cells. Carriers have more oxygen in their blood and perform better in physical activities. Athletes with this variant might be falsely accused of doping.
gene-epor-short-text = Enjoy your super powers!
gene-fgfr3-text = The FGFR3 gene encodes a protein involved in bone development and maintenance. The A mutation is very rare and results in a constantly active protein, leading to shorter and smaller bones. People with this mutation are far smaller than the average (dwarfism).
gene-fgfr3-short-text = Good things come in small packages! 
gene-gjb2-text = The GJB2 gene encodes a membrane protein involved in cell-to-cell communication in different tissues, including the ear. Deletion of the G nucleotide is associated with deafness, and is the most common variant associated with deafness in Europeans. 
gene-gjb2-short-text = Try using this hearing aid.
gene-hbb-text = The HBB gene encodes a subunit of haemoglobin that binds oxygen in the blood. People carrying two T variants (inherited from their parents) suffer from a condition known as sickle-cell anemia. They have malformed and sticky red blood cells that clump together and interfere with the blood flow. Individuals with only one T variant are healthy, and also more resistant to Malaria.
gene-hbb-short-text = Your red blood cells are shaped like a crescent...
gene-herc2-text = The G variant is found in the HERC2 gene intron. It has no influence on the HERC2 protein but influences translation of the neighbouring OCA2 gene. OCA2 protein is essential for melanin synthesis (dark pigment). The G variant leads to lower levels of OCA2 protein, fewer cell pigments and subsequently heightens the probability of blue eyes. This variant is very common in Europe.
gene-herc2-short-text = Blue eyes! Lucky you!
gene-lct-text = The LCT gene encodes a protein essential for digesting milk. The C mutation leads to a disease called "Congenital Lactase Deficiency". People with this variant are unable to digest breast milk as babies, and any other milk products as adults.
gene-lct-short-text = No choice here! Only lactose-free milk for you!
gene-mc1r-text = The MC1R gene encodes a key protein involved in the colour of human skin and hair. The T variant leads to an increase of red/yellow pigments (pheomelanin). T-variant carriers have lighter skin and red hair. The T variant is very rare in Africans because losing dark pigments would make skin cells vulnerable to strong sunlight. However, the T variant is less harmful in European populations because the sunlight is weaker.
gene-mc1r-short-text = Red hair!
gene-mcm6-text = The C variant is found in the MCM6 gene intron and increases the translation of the neighbouring gene LCT. LCT produces a protein responsible for digesting milk. C-variant carriers are lactose-intolerant when adults, but can digest breast milk.
gene-mcm6-short-text = Keep away from milk as an adult!
gene-oca2-text = The OCA2 gene encodes a protein involved in melanin synthesis (dark pigment). Mutations in this gene, such as the T variant can lead to the production of less melanin. Normal melanin levels cause brown eyes, reduced levels of melanin to green eyes, while very low levels or no melanin at all lead to blue eyes.
gene-oca2-short-text = You are more likely to have brown eyes!
gene-opn1mw-text = The OPN1MW gene encodes a protein sensitive to yellow and green light, and is found in the retina. Variations in this gene can lead to an impaired red-green colour vision (Deuteranopia/Colour blindness). The variant is frequent in European men. Women, however, are less likely to suffer from this type of colour blindness because the OPN1MW gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes thus increasing the probability of having a functional OPN1MW gene.
gene-opn1mw-short-text = Red and green are all the same to you!
gene-opn4-text = The OPN4 gene encodes a photoreceptor able to measure light intensity. The T mutation decreases the protein's activity. Individuals with the less active protein version react more strongly to an absence of sunlight. This mutation is present in a subset of people who suffer from depression in the winter (seasonal affective disorder) due to the decrease in sunlight.
gene-opn4-short-text = You might be prone to depression in winter...
gene-or2j3-text = The OR2J3 gene encodes a nasal olfactory protein. The G variant decreases sensitivity to a molecule released by wounded plants (e.g. cut grass). People with this variant cannot smell cut grass. The same molecule is also present in fresh vegetables and fruit. The G variant could therefore influence an individual's food preferences.
gene-or2j3-short-text = You can't smell cut grass!
gene-pcdh15-text = The PCDH15 gene encodes a protein important for our eyes and ears. The C to T mutation in this gene often leads to a disease called "Usher syndrome type 1", which causes deafness and concurrent blindness.
gene-pcdh15-short-text = This mutation is related to deafness and blindness.
gene-per2-text = The PER2 gene encodes a protein involved in the sleep-wake rhythm. Carriers of the G mutation have decreased PER2 protein levels and suffer from "Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome" where their sleep cycle is shifted: they go to bed very early (6-8 pm) but also wake up very early (3 am).
gene-per2-short-text = You're a morning lark!
gene-sh2b3-text = The SH2B3 gene encodes a regulatory protein involved in blood cell development, inflammatory processes and cell migration, and is strongly expressed in the small intestine. The T mutation may lead to a more sensitive protein that triggers a strong auto-immune response to ingested gluten (celiac disease).
gene-sh2b3-short-text = Gluten-free please!
gene-slc24a5-text = The SLC24A5 gene encodes a protein involved in skin pigmentation. The A variant evolved recently and is found in almost 100% of Europeans. A-variant carriers have lighter skin. In areas of decreased light intensity (e.g. Northern Europe), lighter skin facilitates UV absorption and subsequently the synthesis of Vitamin D.
gene-slc24a5-short-text = You have light skin!
gene-slc45a2-text = The SLC45A2 gene encodes a protein involved in melanin synthesis (dark pigment). The C variant is usually not present in Europeans. However, if a person is of European ancestry and carries the C variant, he/she is more likely to have black hair.
gene-slc45a2-short-text = You may have black hair!
gene-tas2r38-text = The TAS2R38 gene encodes a taste receptor for bitterness. G-variant carriers cannot taste bitter substances in food like cabbage or raw broccoli. Such variants may influence food preference and diet.
gene-tas2r38-short-text = Raw broccoli tastes bitter to you!
gene-tcf7l2-text = The TCF7L2 gene encodes a protein that regulates gene transcription. Some of the genes controlled by TCF7L2 are involved in glucose metabolism and blood sugar levels. If these genes are mal-regulated, the risk of developing diabetes type 2 is increased.
gene-tcf7l2-short-text = This mutation is associated with a risk of diabetes.
gene-tchh-text = The TCHH gene encodes a protein that gives mechanical strength to hair fibres. T-variant carriers have weaker and curlier hair fibres.
gene-tchh-short-text = You've got curly hair!
gene-serpine1-text = The SERPINE1 gene encodes a protein essential for blood clotting following an injury. A mutation in this gene was recently associated with an increased life span in the Amish population - though the exact contribution of SERPINE1 in this is unknown.
gene-serpine1-short-text = You may have a longer life span!
gene-smarcad1-text = The SMARCAD1 gene encodes a protein expressed in skin cells. The T mutation causes a rare condition known as adermatoglyphia. People with adermatoglyphia lack skin ridges on their fingertips and can therefore not be identified by their fingerprints.
gene-smarcad1-short-text = Good luck with customs!
gene-foxo3-text = The FOXO3 gene encodes a protein that controls cell death. Variations in this gene have been associated with longevity in Japanese. Interestingly, the variant in women and men is not the same: Men have a G variant in the intron, while women carry a T variant. How these two variations influence longevity is not known.
gene-foxo3-short-text = You may live to the age of 100!
gene-akt1-text = The AKT1 gene encodes a protein expressed in the brain, and controls cell survival. The C variant enhances the psychotic reaction to Cannabis. Cannabis is used for medical treatment, so it is important to understand how people react to its consumption.
gene-akt1-short-text = You may be a strong reactor to cannabis. 
gene-tutorial-short-text = Your appearance has changed!

static-about-game-text = <b>GOAL OF GAME:</b> Genome Jumper is one of the projects developed by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics to celebrate its 20th anniversary. The game’s goal is to introduce the basic concepts of how information contained in our DNA leads to the production of proteins, while exploring the impact of certain genetic variations. Human beings are the owners of about 20’000 protein-coding genes. Every gene is characterised by a sequence of varied length, which is “written” with a four-letter alphabet: A (for Adenine), G (for Guanine), C (for Cytosine), and T (for Thymine). Bioinformatics is paramount in developing the knowledge that is outlined to players in this game because it uses computational technologies to analyse and store biological data.  \n \n<b>CONCEPT:</b> Thirty genes form the basis of Genome Jumper, each of which is associated with different traits such as the colour of our eyes, baldness or an illness. As the avatar moves along each gene, it will “encounter” genetic variations. These variations will have an effect on the avatar’s traits, which will be visualized by an accessory or a phenotype that is added to the avatar.\n \n<b>SCIENTIFIC VERACITY:</b>\n    1) The aspect of each avatar is the result of 3 genes, each of which carries a variation. Every human being owns 20’000 genes and millions of variations. The link between a variation and a phenotype is extremely difficult to establish: it is very rare that one sole variation is responsible for one phenotype. Indeed, both the environment and other factors – which are still poorly understood – can also play a major role on the effects of variations. One of the goals of biomedical research, with the help of bioinformatics, is precisely to study and get a better understanding of the link between genetic variations and phenotypes. \n    2) In the case of variations associated with an illness, it is very important to underline the fact that, yet again, it is not because an individual carries such a mutation that he or she will necessarily develop the said illness. What it means is that he or she simply has a higher risk of developing the illness. Though we have done our best to treat the subject with great care and diplomacy, SIB apologizes in advance if a player, familiar with an illness described in the game, is offended in any way.    \n    3) The avatars run along the RNA sequence of different genes (before any splicing event). Most of these transcripts, as they are called, were chosen from Ensembl, a renowned databank. The number of exons and introns found on each sequence has been respected, however, for the game’s sake, their lengths have been standardized. Each variation has been positioned on the correct exons/introns according to data extracted from the scientific literature. Thymine has been replaced by Uracil since the avatars run along the RNA sequence of a gene, and not its DNA sequence. The way spliceosomes and SR proteins (splicing enhancers) function has been simplified for the game. The RNA bases and secondary structures have been distributed randomly along the sequence.     \n
static-about-game-paragraph-1 = BUT DU JEU. Genome Jumper a été développé pour fêter les 20 ans du SIB Institut Suisse de Bioinformatique. Il a pour but d’introduire la bioinformatique à un large public, et reprend des concepts qui traduisent notre ADN en protéines fonctionnels tout en explorant ses variations et mutations.
static-about-game-paragraph-2 = CONCEPT. Le jeu propose d’explorer une trentaine de gènes associés à différentes caractéristiques comme la couleur des yeux, la calvitie ou certaines maladies. Dans le cas d’une maladie, il est important de savoir que le fait de porter une mutation ne signifie pas forcément que l’on va nécessairement contracter la maladie en question, mais qu’il y a seulement un risque. Bien que nous ayons traité le sujet avec la plus grande prudence et diplomatie, le SIB s’excuse d’avance si un joueur familiarisé avec une maladie représentée dans le jeu s’en ressent offusqué d’une manière ou d’une autre.
static-about-game-paragraph-3 = VÉRACITÉ SCIENTIFIQUE. Le jeu essaie “au mieux” de respecter la véracité scientifique de certains aspects: Les transcripts choisis sont, dans la majorité des cas, pris d’Ensembl. Le nombre d’exons et d’introns est respecté, mais les longueurs ont été normalisées afin que le jeu soit “jouable”. Les variations et mutations sont placées dans les bons exons / introns et sont extraites de publications. La thymine est remplacée par l’uracile puisque l’on se trouve au niveau de l’ARN et non de l’ADN. Le fonctionnement du spliceosome et les SR (splicing enhancer) protéine ont été gamifiée. Les bases de l’ARN ainsi que ses structures secondaires ont été mises aléatoirement au long de la chaîne.
static-publications-label = Publications
gloss-chromosome-label = Chromosome
gloss-chromosome-text = A chromosome is a more or less compactly wound thread of DNA, a little like a ball of wool. In some organisms, including humans, chromosomes appear in their popular 'X' form at the time of cell division, and dark and light horizontal bands alternate along their length when specific colourings are used. The topography of these bands is characteristic of a chromosome and used to identify it.
gloss-dna-label = DNA
gloss-dna-text = DNA is a chain of nucleotides that are linked to one another via chemical bonds. There are four different nucleotides: adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine symbolised by A, C, G and T respectively. The order of nucleotides is very precise in DNA, and is the basis of genetic information. More often than not, DNA has a 'double helix' structure made up of two long strands. The strands are linked to each other via the nucleotides, where adenine (A) always binds to thymine (T), and guanine (G) to cytosine (C), rather like a twisted ladder.
gloss-exon-label = Exon
gloss-exon-text = An exon is a small piece of DNA or RNA that encodes the information used to produce a protein. Genes often consist of several exons.
gloss-gene-label = Gene
gloss-gene-text = A gene is a piece of DNA. One gene can carry the recipe to make a protein, for example.
gloss-genome-label = Genome
gloss-genome-text = The sum of DNA found in one cell. As a rule, every cell in an organism has the same genome.
gloss-intron-label = Intron
gloss-intron-text = Introns are the intervening regions between exons and do not code for proteins. They are often much larger than exons, because they play an important role in controlling gene expression and splicing. During the splicing reaction itself, introns are removed from the RNA sequence. 
gloss-karyotype-label = Karyotype
gloss-karyotype-text = The karyotype represents the number of chromosomes and their appearance in a species. Since different species have different chromosomes, the karyotype is specific for each of them. 
gloss-messengerRNA-label = Messenger RNA (mRNA)
gloss-messengerRNA-text = The mRNA is the product of splicing. During this phase, the introns between the exons are removed, and the exons are joined to one another. mRNA is translated into a protein.  
gloss-mutation-label = Mutation
gloss-mutation-text = A mutation occurs when one or more nucleotides are modified in a DNA sequence. A mutation can involve exchanging one nucleotide for another, or deleting or adding one or more nucleotides. Not every mutation has an effect on a gene, but when it does, it alters the corresponding protein's function and can cause a disease. Mutations happen spontaneously or are the result of chemical agents such as UV radiation or a virus. About 10 mutations are thought to occur every time a cell divides. Mutations are also the source of evolution.
gloss-nucleotide-label = Nucleotide
gloss-nucleotide-text = Basic unit of DNA and RNA. Nucleotides are molecules symbolised by letters. In DNA, A is for adenine, T for thymine, G for guanine and C for cytosine. In RNA, T is replaced by U for uracil. In RNA, the T is replaced by the U (Uracil)
gloss-phenotype-label = Phenotype
gloss-phenotype-text = An organism's phenotype is the sum of its observable traits, such as its appearance, physiological properties or behaviour. Phenotypes are the fruit of an organism's genotype (its DNA, or genetic heritage) and its environment. Each phenotype is therefore unique. 
gloss-preMessengerRNA-label = pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA)
gloss-preMessengerRNA-text = The pre-mRNA is the product of transcription. It contains the UTRs, introns and exons.
gloss-protein-label = Protein
gloss-protein-text = Like pearls in a necklace, a protein is a succession of amino acids that are linked to one another via chemical bonds. There are 20 different amino acids. Proteins are of variable length and fold into specific shapes – their 3D structure – which determine their function. Proteins are essential for a living being’s construction and activity.
gloss-rna-label = RNA
gloss-rna-text = RNA can be described as a photocopy of a piece of DNA. Its chemical composition is very close to that of DNA but is only made up of one strand. RNA acts as a 'messenger', and is essential in the synthesis of proteins. There are also other types of RNA, which are not directly involved in protein synthesis.
gloss-secondary-structure-label = RNA secondary structure
gloss-secondary-structure-text = Much like DNA that is wound up in chromosomes, RNA also has a secondary structure. This structure not only protects RNA from damage but can also interact with proteins.
gloss-spliceosome-label = Spliceosome
gloss-spliceosome-text = The spliceosome is a large complex made up of different proteins whose role is to remove the introns from the pre-mRNA during the splicing reaction.
gloss-splicing-label = Splicing 
gloss-splicing-text = Splicing is the intermediate step in protein synthesis. It is performed by the spliceosome that removes the introns. The UTRs, however, are not removed. 
gloss-splicing-enhancer-label = Splicing enhancer 
gloss-splicing-enhancer-text = A splicing enhancer refers to a small segment of DNA or RNA that serves as a binding platform for a specific class of proteins. Once bound to a splicing enhancer, proteins can enhance and support the splicing of pre-mRNA into mRNA. 
gloss-start-codon-label = Start codon
gloss-start-codon-text = The start codon is the very first codon on a protein's mRNA. This codon is usually formed by the nucleotide trio AUG, and leads to the incorporation of the amino acid Methionine at the beginning of the protein sequence.
gloss-stop-codon-label = Stop codon
gloss-stop-codon-text = The stop codon is the last codon on the mRNA to be translated. It is usually formed by the nucleotide trios UAG, UAA or UGA.
gloss-transcription-label = Transcription
gloss-transcription-text = Transcription is the first step in protein synthesis. During this step, a protein known as RNA polymerase binds to the DNA (gene) and transcribes it into RNA.
gloss-translation-label = Translation
gloss-translation-text = Translation is the last step in protein synthesis. Large complex molecules known as ribosomes bind to the mRNA and translate the information stored to synthesize protein. 
gloss-utr-label = UTR
gloss-utr-text = UTR stands for "Untranslated Region". These regions are located at either end of the mRNA. They do not code for a protein but can regulate RNA translation, and hence protein synthesis. 
gloss-ribosome-label = Ribosome
gloss-ribosome-text = A ribosome is a protein factory. It reads the information held in the messenger RNA and translates it into a protein, using the genetic code. Every cell has thousands of ribosomes.
gloss-variant-label = Variant
gloss-variant-text = All humans are unique. Some have red hair, others black, some prefer to do a lot of sport while others can spend hours reading books. This diversity in how we look and how we behave is caused by different variants in our DNA. A variant refers to a specific location within our genome where nucleotides differ between organisms of the same species. These variations can influence the activity of genes, and thus a variety of phenotypes. If a variant is rare and only carried by few people, it is usually referred to as a mutation. If a given variant is found in many people, it is also known as a polymorphism.

TutorialSpliceosome = This is a <b>Spliceosome</b>. Spliceosomes are responsible for RNA splicing (removing the non-coding parts, or introns). In this game, a spliceosome helps you cross huge introns and is a platform that moves on its own. Don't fall!
TutorialSRProtein = This is a <b>Splicing Enhancer</b>. This small protein helps you enhance splicing and lets your avatar cross introns. Run and jump on it to be catapulted!
TutorialStartCodon = This is a <b>Start Codon</b>. It is the first codon to be translated by your friend the ribosome. In mammals, it is usually AUG which encodes Methionine. Catch it to get another star!
TutorialStopCodon = This is the <b>Stop Codon</b> (or termination codon). It tells the ribosome to stop translating the RNA into protein. Catch it!
TutorialUTR = This is an <b>Untranslated Region(UTR) </b>. UTRs are found at the beginning and the end of a gene and do not encode for proteins. You can run safely on them. 
TOS = Terms of service
Victory = You've made it!
